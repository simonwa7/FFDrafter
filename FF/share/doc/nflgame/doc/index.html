  <p>nflgame is an API to retrieve and read NFL Game Center JSON data.
It can work with real-time data, which can be used for fantasy football.</p>
<p>nflgame works by parsing the same JSON data that powers NFL.com's live
GameCenter. Therefore, nflgame can be used to report game statistics while
a game is being played.</p>
<p>The package comes pre-loaded with game data from every pre- and regular
season game from 2009 up until the present (I try to update it every week).
Therefore, querying such data does not actually ping NFL.com.</p>
<p>However, if you try to search for data in a game that is being currently
played, the JSON data will be downloaded from NFL.com at each request (so be
careful not to inspect for data too many times while a game is being played).
If you ask for data for a particular game that hasn't been cached to disk
but is no longer being played, it will be automatically cached to disk
so that no further downloads are required.</p>
<p>Here's a quick teaser to find the top 5 running backs by rushing yards in the
first week of the 2013 season:</p>
<pre><code>#!python
import nflgame

games = nflgame.games(2013, week=1)
players = nflgame.combine_game_stats(games)
for p in players.rushing().sort('rushing_yds').limit(5):
    msg = '%s %d carries for %d yards and %d TDs'
    print msg % (p, p.rushing_att, p.rushing_yds, p.rushing_tds)

<p>And the output is:</p>
<pre><code>L.McCoy 31 carries for 184 yards and 1 TDs
T.Pryor 13 carries for 112 yards and 0 TDs
S.Vereen 14 carries for 101 yards and 0 TDs
A.Peterson 18 carries for 93 yards and 2 TDs
R.Bush 21 carries for 90 yards and 0 TDs
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could find the top 5 passing plays in the same time period:</p>
<pre><code>#!python

<p>And the output is:</p>
<pre><code>(DEN, DEN 22, Q4, 3 and 8) (4:42) (Shotgun) P.Manning pass
